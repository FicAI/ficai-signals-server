# Running tests

Besides whatever gets tested by `cargo test`, there are black-box integration tests. Their source is in [`test.sh`](/test.sh). They are based on [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2/) and require it to be accessible on `$PATH` â€” see the last line of `test.sh`. The tests expect all variables needed to run the server to be available in either the environment or in the file `test.env` (ignored by git), which you can make for yourself by copying and modifying `test.env.template`.
